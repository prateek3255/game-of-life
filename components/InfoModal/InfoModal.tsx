        What is Game of Life?
      </h1>
      <p className="sm:mt-8 mt-6">
        Game of Life is a cellular automaton invented by British mathematician
        John Horton Conway in 1970. It consists of a 2-dimensional grid of
        cells, each having an alive or dead (or on or off) state. An initial
        state of the grid can be selected by assigning a state to each cell. New
        generations of cells can then be created based on the state of the
        current cells and their neighbouring cells with some dead simple rules.
        It is a zero-player game, which means that its evolution is determined
        by just its initial state, requiring no further input.
      </p>
      <h2 className="sm:text-3xl text-xl font-bold sm:mt-12 mt-10">Rules</h2>
      <p className="mt-2">
        It has 3 pretty straightforward rules, which dictate the evolution of
        one generation of cells to another. But before we dive into the rules,
        let's look at some basic terminology that would be required for
        understanding the rules.

        and the cells on the top edge have their neighbours on the bottom.

      <p className="mt-6">
        The main thing that fascinates most people and me about this game is the
        fact that how complexity arises out of simplicity. With these
        dead-simple rules, someone might think that this game should be very
        predictable and boring. The magic begins once you start experimenting
        with it and see the complex patterns emerge out of simple initial
        states. And how slight changes in the initial state can produce a huge
        change in output from complete destruction (no alive cells left) through
        frozen patterns and to patterns that keep moving for eternity. Hope you
        enjoy this as well ‚úåüèª.
